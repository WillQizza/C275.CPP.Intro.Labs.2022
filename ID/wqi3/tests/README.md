# Tests

This directory contains the code that runs the test runner that runs the tests in each lab. This code was written specifically for these intro labs. 
However, it requires a little work to setup given that it is in Node.js and the CMPUT 274 virtual image does not include Node.js by default.

## Setup

- `sudo apt-get install nodejs`
